    "Temporary Collective evolved out of a performance course taught by Randy Lee Cutler in the spring of 2018 at Emily Carr University.",
    "Responses to the Collection is an ongoing series that invites a broad range of guest contributors to select work from the Outdoor Art Collection as subjects for reflection and response. Exploring how the UBC campus can be a fruitful place for experimentation and learning, Temporary Collective have come together to perform through movement and rhythmic gestures, responses to Asiatic Head by Otto Fischer-Credo (1958/1977) and The Shadow by Esther Shalev-Gerz (2018). The collective of ten artists attempts to dialogue with these two very different artworks by generating an embodied engagement with site, materiality and history."
